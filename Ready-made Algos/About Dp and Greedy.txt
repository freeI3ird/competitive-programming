Dynamic Programming and Greedy are Brother and Sister :

How to Approach Problems for them :
Steps :
1. Try to find Optimal Structure(substructure) in problem.
2. See if Overlapping problems are there.
3. Form the Recursive definition.

Now This problem can be definitely solved by 'DP'. 
What about Greedy? 
Always Ask Yourself if you can reduce one or many sides of the recursive soln or optimal structure.
	- Make Some Greedy choice.
	- Check if Greedy choice is safe
		if safe then GREEDY 
		ELSE DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING.
